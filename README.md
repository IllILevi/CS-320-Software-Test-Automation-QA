# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Through multiple types testing, I can ensure that my code is functional and secure. However, if I'm testing the same code that I've written, it can be quite easy to become biased and overlook something that shouldn't be. 
This can be combated through code reviews and static and dynamic analsysis. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
This can be done by gathering requirments through interviews, surveys, etc,. Then creating user personas and stories to better help focus on what needs to be incoroperted in the program, and finally conduct interviews through a prototype of the program and see how user's interact with it and give feedback on it.

# How do I approach designing software?
My first step is defining the requirements and objectives of what needs to be done. I then break them down into smaller pieces and based on functionality. For instance, with the contactSerivce class, the required features were to add, delete, and update a contact. Therefore, I implmeented those three features into their own respective functions.
